<h1>
    About Us
</h1>

<div>
    We are a team of people working towards a common goal of teaching our kids new tools and technologies and
    encouraging them to use those tools for a better future.
    We are parents, geeks and lifetime learners ourselves. We are constantly looking on ways to understand new tools,
    and working on modifying those tools to make them easy enough for a five year old to use.
